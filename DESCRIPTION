Description: Implementations for the Bayesian fine-mapping method CAusal Robust Mapping method with Annotations (CARMA). CARMA uses common GWAS data and linkage disequilibrium (LD) from external panels to predict causal variants.  CARMA allows users to introduce functional annotations to jointly models summary statistics of GWAS and high-dimensional functional annotations. Also, CARMA provides a novel Bayesian hypothesis testing approach to account for discrepancies between summary statistics and LD from external reference panels in order to avoid an increase in false positives.
